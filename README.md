# Optimization of Monitoring Methods

The goal of this project was to identify optimal monitoring scenarios for brown treesnakes while explicitly considering tradeoffs between the accuracy and precision of abundance estimates and the cost of conducting each monitoring scenario. This objective-driven optimization was integral to managers making cost-effective decisions regarding the suppression of this invasive species. We 1) analyzed real monitoring data collected in a population of brown treesnakes, 2) used estimates of key parameters describing the performance of these methods to seed monitoring simulations, 3) generated a list of monitoring scenarios of interest that varied the application of monitoring method by spatial and temporal deployment in different brown treesnake populations, and 4) assessed how each scenario performed via comparison by several metrics.

Monitoring methods of interest were visual surveys (VIS; involving a surveyor hand-capturing snakes) or live trapping surveys (TRAP; involving a live mouse lure inside a snake trap). Snakes could be detected multiple times an evening with visual surveys but remained in traps overnight when using live trapping.

The alternative monitoring scenarios we assessed varied by:
Spatial application (half or the full number of transects)
Temporal application (14 or 30 days)
Monitoring method (VIS, TRAP, or VISTRAP - a combination of both)
Snake density (Normal [120] or reduced [60] snakes in the target area)
Snake size distribution (larger proportion of smaller- or larger-sized snakes)
