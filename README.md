# OptimizationMethods
Identify optimal monitoring methods and the spatial and temporal deployment needed to obtain brown treesnake abundance estimates

Pulls data from multiple projects and monitoring techniques (e.g., visual surveys, trap captures, bait tubes, telemetry, etc.)

Allows us to connect each project and its costs and effort to the estimates we obtain so we may weigh tradeoffs with improvements in abundance estimates (as judged by minimizing RMSE)
